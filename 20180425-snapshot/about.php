<h2>Location</h2>
One of the most attractive aspects of Woodcreek is its location, and our homes appreciate well partly due to the growing demand of the area. We enjoy a prime location close to just about everything in the Triangle. We are located about 15 minutes from Duke and UNC, about 5 minutes from shopping at <A href="http://www.streetsatsouthpoint.com/">Southpoint</a>. We're also about 5 minutes from <a href="http://www.rtp.org/">RTP</a>, which offers a variety of restaurants and attractions besides places of employment. For convenient travel, we're a short 15-20 minute drive from the Raleigh-Durham airport.<br>
<br>
We're close enough to enjoy events and outings in <a href="http://www.townofcary.org/">Cary</a>/Apex, <a href="http://www.ci.morrisville.nc.us/">Morrisville</a>, <a href="http://www.ci.chapel-hill.nc.us/">Chapel Hill</a>, and <a href="http://www.raleigh-nc.org/">Raleigh</a>. In short, we're probably within reasonable distance of any source of employment or outing in the Triangle.
